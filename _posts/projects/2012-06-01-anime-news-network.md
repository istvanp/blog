Anime News Network is the number one English language Japanese animation news source and ranks in the top 3,000 of monthly traffic in the United States.

The website redesign is an immense challenge due to the web site's size and the need to meet the needs of many stakeholders. The design is not only a cosmetic refresh but a new push to improve user experience. One of the main changes is a liquid and responsive design.

The last redesign (version 4) occurred in 2008.
