Tutor With Me is a web startup that I founded with three other partners in early 2011 in Montreal, Canada. It's a marketplace for students and tutors where they can meet and learn in an online environment.

## OnBoard
The virtual classroom environment, dubbed OnBoard, was developed in-house using [Node.JS](http://nodejs.org/) and WebSockets. A demo is available from the [homepage]({{ page.website }}).
